# Overview
Jasper is an opensource project designed to make the process of creating a self-standing "Alexis"-style assistant. Because the project hasn't seen any new commits since 2017, it's a pretty tough project to get working for experienced engineers and few have ever successfully completed the task. But the value of a standalone voice assistant that does not interact with 3rd parties is important. Thus the creation of this DIY (do it yourself) guide. 

This guide (with special thanks to Steve Keukes who provided the original draft) steps through the process of building a fully-functional Jasper installation on a Raspberry Pi. The guide should work if the user can be trusted to type commands *as written* with no additional creativity added. Every repository used by this guide has been safely forked and linked within GitHub. All files used have been stored in an accompanying SourceForge project owned by the author of this guide (Adam Peacock) at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperclient/files/.

#### Work is underway to convert Jasper to Python 3 - the progress of which can be monitored [HERE](github.com/aplawson/jasper-client/tree/jasper-client-python3)

#### Package details are listed [HERE](#package-details)

# Jasper on Raspian Buster Software Installation Guide
This install process was tested on a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+ and Model 4 using the Raspian Buster Lite ISO (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperclient/files/2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.zip). The file can be downloaded from the public repo but to emnsure the file versions do not change, the IMG file was moved to SourcerForge to ensure the version of the initial OS is known/tested. This tutorial used a USB microphone and speakers that plug into the audio jack and uses PocketSphinx for the speech-to-text (STT) and Festival for text-to-speech (TTS). This method is fairly secure in that there is no traffic sent to 3rd parties.

# Feeling Lazy?
A fully-functional Jasper installation was burned to an IMG file that works on any RPI 3B+ (possibly other models but they haven't been tested). The file can downloaded directly at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperclient/files/jasper-rpi.zip/download and written to an SD-card using any image burning software (i.e. Etcher). The username and password were not changed from the Raspbian defaults. (Username: `pi` Password: `raspberry`)

# Installation Guide
Boot the Raspian image on the RPi device and sign in.
Use `raspi-config` to enable the network adapter or wireless as needed and enable SSH to make thigns easier.
Plug in the microphone and speakers then restart the Pi.

    ssh pi@<ip-address>

## Update and install some utilities
    sudo apt-get -y update
    sudo apt-get -y upgrade
    sudo apt-get install -y vim git-core python-dev bison libasound2-dev libportaudio-dev python-pyaudio dos2unix
    sudo apt-get install -y python-setuptools
    sudo python /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy_install.py pip

## Create/edit ALSA configuration file:
    sudo touch /lib/modprobe.d/jasper.conf &&  sudo chown pi /lib/modprobe.d/jasper.conf && sudo cat > /lib/modprobe.d/jasper.conf<<EOF
    #Loads USB audio before the internal soundcard
    options snd_usb_audio index=0
    options snd_bcm2835
    #snd_bcm2835 = built-in audio jack
    #snd_usb_audio = USB-connected microphone
    #Makes sure the sound cards are listed as desired in ALSA
    #Verify order (and what ALSA sees) by entering "alsamixer" at the command line
    #If a device is not listed, reboot the device and try again.
    #options snd slots=<capture_device>,<playback_device>
    options snd slots=snd_usb_audio,snd_bcm2835
    EOF
    sudo reboot

## Test the microphone and speakers:
Note: This tutorial mentions `alsamixer` as a handy tool to test playback and microphone gain/volume. However, if certain aspects of alsamixer don't work quite right (i.e. F4 Capture), feel free to troubleshoot but don't add software binaries not mentioned in this guide unless you know what you're doing. * Remember this tool is a matter convenience - not a requirement.
* To start alsamixer: `$ alsamixer`
* Press `F6` to select microphone
* Press `F4` to capture
* Press up arrow to increase microphone gain
* To record: `$ arecord test.wav`, speak into the microphone, end recording: `Ctrl + C`
* To playback: `$ aplay -D hw:1,0 test.wav`

## Edit & source profile scripts:
    touch .bash_profile && cat>>.bash_profile<<EOF
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/fst"
    EOF
    $ source .bash_profile
    $ touch .bashrc && cat>>.bashrc<<EOF
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/fst"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/fst
    export PATH
    EOF
    $ source .bashrc

## The authoritative repo for jasper is at https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client.git but it hasn't been updated since 2017. This tutorial uses a forked repo:
    git clone https://github.com/aplawson/jasper-client.git jasper
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aplawson/jasperbuster/master/jasper.patch
    cd jasper && patch -p1 < ../jasper.patch
    cd

## Install needed Python libraries
    sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
    sudo pip install -r jasper/client/requirements.txt        #### this takes a while

## Create the Jasper profile
    cd ~/jasper/client
    python populate.py
    cd
